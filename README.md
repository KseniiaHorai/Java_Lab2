# Lab2: String Manipulation in Java

## Objective
The goal is to familiarize with strings and learn how to use common methods for string manipulation in Java. The task will involve applying different string-related operations based on specific conditions, using different string types in Java.

## Tasks

### Determining String Type and Actions
- **C3**: `String`
- **C17**: `5`: Print the unique words in the text in alphabetical order.

### Implementation
A class will be created using a method that performs the required operation on the text. The method will use the appropriate string type ( **String**). All potential edge cases will be handled, and the variables will be clearly defined and assigned in the method. 

### Coding Standards
The code will adhere to Java Code Conventions (or Google Java Style Guide) to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
